Testing notes. 
This does two things:

The dg-home setting tells the plugin that this should be your home page or entry into your digital garden. (It only needs to be added to one note, not every note you'll publish).
The dg-publish setting tells the plugin that this note should be published to your digital garden. Notes without this setting will not be published. (In other terms: Every note you publish will need this property.)

Open your command pallete by pressing CTRL+P on Windows/Linux (CMD+P on Mac) and find the "Digital Garden: Publish Single Note" command. Press enter.
